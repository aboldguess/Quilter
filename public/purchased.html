  Patchwork Purchased Tiles Page
  ------------------------------
  Mini README:
  This HTML page lists tiles that have been purchased in the current game.
  It allows players to review their buys, see each tile's value at the time of
  purchase, and optionally return a tile to the available pool.

  Structure:
  - Instructions header with navigation back to the game
  - Table displaying purchased tiles and their purchase-time values
  - Script handling rendering and return actions
