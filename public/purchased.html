<!--
  Patchwork Purchased Tiles Page
  ------------------------------
  Mini README:
  This HTML page lists tiles that have been purchased in the current game. It
  shows the gross and net scores each tile had when bought along with
  efficiency metrics and optionally lets players return a tile to the available
  pool. Running scores are computed by summing purchased net values and
  subtracting 162 to produce each player's final score.

  Structure:
  - Instructions header with navigation back to the game
  - Running score display for yellow and green players
  - Optional dropdown to choose visible metric on small screens
  - Table displaying purchase-time score metrics with a player column
  - Script handling rendering and return actions (action column hidden on small screens)
