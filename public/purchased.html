  Patchwork Purchased Tiles Page
  ------------------------------
  Mini README:
  This HTML page lists tiles that have been purchased in the current game.
  It allows players to review their buys and optionally return a tile to the
  available pool. Columns in the table can be clicked to sort the purchases.

  Structure:
  - Instructions header with navigation back to the game
  - Table displaying purchased tiles with sortable columns
  - Script handling rendering and return actions
